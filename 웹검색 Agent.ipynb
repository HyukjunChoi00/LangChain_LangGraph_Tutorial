       "  'body_content': 'Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has officially launched its Model Y in India, listing prices starting at ₹59.89 lakh (approx. $69,700) for the rear-wheel drive variant. The long-range version is priced at ₹67.89 lakh, according to Tesla’s India website. These prices, which exclude taxes, are significantly higher than the Model Y’s U.S. base price of $44,490 and Bloomberg’s reported $56,000 sticker price. The vehicles will be imported from Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory in China. Sales will initially be limited to New Delhi and Mumbai, where Tesla is also opening its first Indian showrooms this July. The Mumbai showroom is expected to open this week, followed by a New Delhi location by month-end. Despite the launch, Tesla has no current plans to set up local manufacturing in India. Previous discussions with the Indian government on factory establishment failed to produce a deal, leaving Tesla reliant on imports that incur steep duties—contributing to the higher price tag. Tesla’s entry into India comes amid slowing sales in its key markets, including the U.S., China, and Europe, prompting the EV giant to explore new growth avenues. However, the Indian EV market presents challenges. Local automakers like Tata Motors (NSE:TAMO) and Mahindra & Mahindra (NSE:MAHM) offer competitively priced EVs that cater to the price-sensitive Indian consumer. Tesla will also face stiff competition in the premium EV segment from China’s BYD Co Ltd (HK:1211), which has an established presence and growing footprint in India. With no local production and a premium price point, Tesla’s success in the Indian market will hinge on brand appeal and luxury positioning rather than affordability.'}]"

      "[{'title': 'Mexico’s 50% Tariff Threatens Tesla and BYD in Booming EV Market', 'URL': 'https://econotimes.com/Mexicos-50-Tariff-Threatens-Tesla-and-BYD-in-Booming-EV-Market-1720504', 'body_content': 'Mexico’s proposed 50% tariff on vehicles imported from countries without free trade agreements, including China, could deal a major blow to Tesla and BYD while sparing U.S. automakers Ford, GM, and Stellantis. Industry experts say the measure mainly targets Chinese-manufactured electric cars, which have rapidly gained traction in Mexico’s fast-growing EV market. Over the past year, Mexico has raised tariffs on Chinese-made EVs from 0% to 15%, and now plans to raise them to 50%. Eugenio Grandio, president of the Electric Mobility Association in Mexico, called it a “game-changer.” The proposal still awaits approval from Mexico’s Congress, but Morena’s majority makes passage likely. While the tariff is broad, legacy U.S. automakers are protected by a 2003 decree allowing them to import a percentage of vehicles tariff-free thanks to their production plants in Mexico. Tesla and BYD, lacking factories in the country, would be hit hardest. Tesla suspended plans for a massive plant in northern Mexico in 2024, while BYD abandoned its factory project due to political and trade concerns. Tesla currently imports all its Model 3 and Model Y cars for Mexico from its Shanghai plant, though it may rely on stockpiles and other global factories to soften the impact. BYD, despite scrapping its plant, sold 40,000 cars in Mexico in 2024—nearly half of all EVs sold—and doubled its sales pace in 2025. However, higher tariffs could threaten its competitive pricing, built on Chinese subsidies and low labor costs. China urged Mexico to reconsider, warning of damage to bilateral trade, while U.S. industry groups welcomed the move, saying it boosts North American automakers’ ability to compete.'}, {'title': 'Tesla Ordered to Pay $243M in Florida Autopilot Crash Verdict', 'URL': 'https://econotimes.com/Tesla-Ordered-to-Pay-243M-in-Florida-Autopilot-Crash-Verdict-1717846', 'body_content': 'A Florida jury has ordered Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to pay $243 million in damages over a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system, marking a rare legal defeat for the electric vehicle maker. The case centered on a Model S collision that killed Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured Dillon Angulo. Jurors in Miami federal court awarded $129 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages, holding Tesla liable for 33% of the compensatory amount, or $42.6 million. The driver, George McGee, was found 67% liable but is not required to pay damages. The lawsuit alleged Tesla failed to limit Autopilot’s use to controlled-access highways, despite CEO Elon Musk’s public claims that the system drove better than humans. The crash occurred when McGee, distracted by a dropped cellphone, ran a stop sign and collided with the victims’ parked SUV. Tesla denied responsibility and vowed to appeal, arguing no vehicle in 2019—or today—could have prevented the accident and asserting the driver was solely at fault. Legal experts say the ruling could set a precedent, encouraging more lawsuits over Tesla’s driver-assistance technology. It comes as the company faces heightened scrutiny of its self-driving claims and a challenging EV market, with shares down 25% this year. The verdict may also impact Musk’s ambitious plans to expand Tesla’s robotaxi business and autonomous driving program, key drivers of the company’s nearly $1 trillion valuation. This is the first jury verdict holding Tesla liable for a fatal crash linked to Autopilot, raising questions about the safety and regulation of semi-autonomous vehicles as Tesla accelerates development of AI-driven transportation.'}, {'title': 'Tesla Car Sales in France, Denmark, and Sweden Plunge in July Amid Ongoing European Decline', 'URL': 'https://econotimes.com/Tesla-Car-Sales-in-France-Denmark-and-Sweden-Plunge-in-July-Amid-Ongoing-European-Decline-1717783', 'body_content': 'Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw its car sales drop sharply in France, Denmark, and Sweden in July 2025, extending a seven-month decline across key European markets. According to official industry data, Tesla registered 1,307 new vehicles in France last month, marking a 27% decrease compared to July 2024. The broader French auto market also faced an 8% decline in total car sales during the same period. Denmark posted an even steeper drop, with Tesla sales plunging 52% year-on-year to 336 vehicles. Registrations of the Model Y, the company’s most popular model in Europe, fell 49% in Denmark. In contrast, Denmark’s overall car sales rose 20% in July, highlighting Tesla’s underperformance in the region. The downturn was most severe in Sweden, where Tesla’s new car registrations tumbled 85.8% to just 163 vehicles, based on data from Mobility Sweden. These figures reflect broader headwinds facing Tesla in Europe. The company’s sales have dropped by more than one-third across the continent during the first half of 2025, as it faces intensifying competition from local automakers and Chinese electric vehicle (EV) brands. Price adjustments and ongoing supply chain challenges have further pressured Tesla’s market share in Europe, once a key growth driver for the company’s global expansion strategy. The sustained decline underscores shifting dynamics in the European EV market, where traditional automakers and new entrants are ramping up offerings and incentives to capture demand. Industry analysts note that Tesla’s ability to stabilize sales in Europe will be crucial as it navigates a competitive global EV landscape and prepares for upcoming model updates.'}, {'title': 'Tesla Secures $4.3B Battery Deal with LG Energy for U.S. Storage Projects', 'URL': 'https://econotimes.com/Tesla-Secures-43B-Battery-Deal-with-LG-Energy-for-US-Storage-Projects-1717488', 'body_content': 'Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has signed a $4.3 billion agreement with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution Ltd (KS: 373220) to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday. The batteries will reportedly be manufactured at LG Energy’s U.S. facility, though specific production timelines were not disclosed. Earlier in the day, LG Energy had confirmed a $4.3 billion battery and storage technology supply contract but did not identify the customer. LG Energy Solution, one of the world’s largest battery manufacturers, is already a major supplier of lithium-ion batteries to Tesla, particularly for the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles produced in China and Europe. This new deal underscores Tesla’s ongoing strategy to diversify its battery supply chain and increase its capacity for energy storage solutions amid growing demand in the renewable energy sector. While the contract specifies lithium iron phosphate batteries, it remains unclear whether the supply will be dedicated solely to Tesla’s energy storage projects, such as Megapack and Powerwall, or also extend to electric vehicle production in the U.S. The move aligns with Tesla’s broader push to ramp up domestic sourcing of battery components, which has become a key priority under U.S. clean energy incentives and supply chain security initiatives. The partnership further strengthens Tesla’s relationship with LG Energy, signaling potential future collaborations as both companies scale production to meet surging global demand for sustainable energy solutions and EV adoption. This deal is expected to bolster Tesla’s energy storage market position and support its long-term growth strategy in North America.'}]\n"
